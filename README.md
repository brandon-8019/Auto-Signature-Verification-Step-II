# Auto-Signature-Verification-Step-II
### Run the following commands step by step
```python3 code.py```
>  This will extract signatures from noisy images and evaluate angle-features from it.
#
```python3 error_back_propagation.py```
>  This will train an error-backpropagation model with aforesaid angle-features as inputs.
#
```python3 testing_model.py```
>  This is for testing test-images.
